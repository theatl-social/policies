4.1. Scope of Guidelines

These guidelines fully apply to:
- Content created directly by theATL.social users
- Interactions our users have with any content (including federated content)
- Content shared or boosted by our users

4.2. Federation Limitations

4.2.1. Content may appear on our instance through federation with other servers.

4.2.2. We acknowledge limited technical resources and practical ability to moderate federated content that our users have not interacted with.

## 5. Response to Harmful Content

5.1. When we become aware of content that contains exploitative materials (including CSAM), poses immediate risk or harm to others, or violates applicable laws, we will take appropriate action within our technical capabilities.

5.2. We will make best efforts to contact relevant authorities when warranted, though this commitment does not create a legal duty to act or monitor.

## 6. Moderation and Enforcement

6.1. Moderation Authority

theATLSocial Networks LLC may authorize members of the service and, when applicable, third parties to engage in moderation activities. The scope and implementation of moderation may differ between platforms due to their technical architecture:

6.1.1. On Mastodon, our moderation team maintains direct control over content moderation and enforcement actions.

6.1.2. On Bluesky, due to the platform's architecture, moderation may be initially managed by Bluesky or its designated third parties before our moderation team can take action.

6.2. Reporting Process

Users, both on the service and externally, may report content for review by moderators. Upon receiving a report, moderators conduct an initial assessment to determine if the reported content:
- Poses an immediate harm
- Represents a clear violation of these policies
- Otherwise requires immediate action

If content meets any of these criteria, it may be removed prior to full adjudication. Otherwise, content remains visible pending review.

6.3. Moderation Actions and Proportionate Response

Moderators assess each situation individually and implement actions proportionate to the nature and severity of the violation. We consider factors such as the potential harm caused, whether the violation appears intentional, and any history of previous violations.

Moderators may implement one or more of the following actions:

6.3.1. Content-Level Actions
- Inform the user of the violation
- Limit the visibility of the content
- Delete the content

6.3.2. Account-Level Actions
- Temporarily restrict posting privileges
- Permanently restrict posting privileges
- Impose a time-limited account ban
- Permanently remove the user from the service

6.3.3. Special Cases

Accounts determined to be created for spam or other blatantly inauthentic purposes may be removed immediately without warning or appeal. This includes accounts engaging in automated posting, mass registration, or coordinated inauthentic behavior.

6.4. Appeals Process

Users have the right to submit one appeal for any moderation action taken against their content or account. The appeal should include:
- A clear explanation of why the user believes the moderation action was incorrect
- Any relevant context or evidence supporting their position
- A commitment to follow community guidelines if the appeal is granted

theATLSocial Networks LLC will review all appeals but maintains final authority in all adjudication decisions. Once an appeal decision has been made, it is considered final and no further appeals will be considered for that specific incident.

6.5. Policy Updates

The moderation team reserves the right to update these guidelines as needed to address new challenges and maintain community standards.

## 7. Relationship to Terms of Service

7.1. These content guidelines work in conjunction with our Terms of Service. In cases where this policy and the Terms of Service differ, the Terms of Service take precedence.

7.2. The intent of this policy is to provide clear guidance while maintaining flexibility to address novel situations as they arise.

7.3. We encourage users to report content that violates these guidelines and appreciate our community's help in maintaining a positive environment.
