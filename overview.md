# Welcome to theATL.social!

We're excited to have you join our community. This overview helps you understand how our platform works and what you can expect as a member. While this provides key information to get started, we encourage you to review our full policies for complete details.

## Our Community Vision

theATL.social brings together people interested in Metro Atlanta while participating in the broader social media landscape. Whether you're sharing local insights, connecting with neighbors, or engaging in wider conversations, we aim to foster an inclusive, respectful environment where everyone can contribute meaningfully.

## What Makes Us Different

We operate as part of the federated social media ecosystem, which means you can interact with users on other platforms while maintaining your home base with us. Think of it like email – you can communicate with people using different email providers, and the same principle applies here.

## Important Things to Know

Our platform maintains clear guidelines to ensure everyone's experience remains positive and safe. Here are the key points about using theATL.social:

### Community Standards
Our community is designed for adults 18 and over, and we primarily serve users in the United States. All content must comply with applicable federal and state laws.

### Content Guidelines
We welcome diverse content while maintaining important boundaries. Adult content is permitted but must include appropriate content warnings and should not be the primary focus of any account. Commercial and promotional content is welcome when clearly marked and shared in moderation.

We strictly prohibit content that involves:
- Violence, threats, or encouraging harmful acts
- Harassment or coordinated attacks against individuals or groups
- Unauthorized sharing of private personal information
- Hate speech or content promoting discrimination
- Creation of spam or inauthentic accounts
- Impersonation of individuals or organizations

### Privacy and Data
Your public posts may be visible across federated instances, similar to other social platforms. Users should not make any assumptions about the privacy of their content. We recommend reviewing our Privacy Policy for more information.

### Automated Accounts
We welcome bots and automated accounts that enhance our community, provided they operate within our resource usage guidelines and contribute positively to discussions.

## Our Moderation Approach

We believe in transparent, fair moderation. Users can report concerns about content, and our team reviews these reports promptly. While we prefer to address issues through warnings and discussion, serious violations may result in immediate action. We maintain an appeals process for users who wish to contest moderation decisions.

## Getting Started

Whether you're here to share local Atlanta news, connect with neighbors, or participate in broader conversations, we're here to help you get the most out of your experience. Our community thrives when everyone contributes positively.
