 ## Introduction
 These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of theATL.social ("Platform"), operated by theATL.social LLC ("Company"). By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Please read them carefully.

 ## 1. Definitions and Scope

 ### 1.1 Services
 "Services" refers to all services, features, applications, and content hosted on or provided through the Company's resources, including but not limited to the social media platform, APIs, federation services, and any additional services that may be added in the future.

 ### 1.2 Federation and Data Transmission
 The Services operate within a federated network architecture, where user content and data may be transmitted to and from other servers and services outside of the Company's direct control. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that once your data leaves our servers through federation, the Company cannot control and bears no responsibility for how that data may be used, stored, or displayed by third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, how your content may appear on other instances within the federation, how it may be stored or cached by other servers, or how it may be used by third-party services that access the federated network.

 ## 2. Legal Framework
 The Platform operates under the jurisdiction of the State of Georgia, United States of America, and is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.

 ## 3. User Accounts and Responsibilities

 ### 3.1 Account Security
 Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials and all activities conducted through their account. Users must promptly notify the Company of any unauthorized account access or security breaches. Any attempt to circumvent the Platform's security measures, including but not limited to unauthorized access, penetration testing without explicit permission, or exploitation of system vulnerabilities, is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate account termination and potential legal action.

 ### 3.2 Legal Compliance
 Users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations while using the Platform. Any discussion or promotion of illegal activities is strictly prohibited.

 ### 3.3 Resource Usage and Automation
 The Platform welcomes automated accounts, bots, and scripts that enhance the user experience and contribute positively to the community. Users may create and operate multiple accounts, including automated ones, and may utilize scripts, software, or other automated methods to interact with the Platform. Commercial, non-profit, and organizational accounts are permitted and encouraged to participate in the Platform's community.

 However, users must respect and adhere to the Platform's rate limiting and resource conservation measures. Any attempt to circumvent these restrictions, including but not limited to distributed access patterns designed to evade rate limits, is strictly prohibited. Free-tier users must not attempt to circumvent restrictions to access resources or capabilities reserved for paid users.

 Paid users receive higher resource limits and additional capabilities as specified in their service tier. The specific limits and capabilities for each tier are documented in the Platform's technical documentation.

 ## 4. Legal Compliance and Government Requests

 ### 4.1 Compliance with Legal Demands
 The Company has a legal obligation to comply with valid and binding demands for information from authorized government entities, including but not limited to law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies, and judiciary authorities. These demands may take various forms including subpoenas, court orders, warrants, national security letters, or other lawful requests for user information, account data, or platform content.

 ### 4.2 User Notification
 When the Company receives a legal demand for user information, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected users promptly, providing details about the requesting agency and nature of the request. However, notification may be delayed or withheld if we are legally prohibited from disclosing the demand's existence through a binding confidentiality order, if immediate notification would impede an active investigation, or if notification poses a risk to public safety.

 ### 4.3 Transparency Commitment
 The Company maintains a commitment to transparency regarding government and legal demands. We will:
 - Publish regular transparency reports detailing the volume, types, and sources of legal demands received
 - Disclose the general categories of information provided in response to such demands
 - Document instances where user notification was prohibited or delayed
 - Maintain public records of government requests except where legally prohibited
 - Report on the outcomes of challenges to overbroad or inappropriate requests

 ### 4.4 Response Process
 In processing legal demands, the Company will:
 - Verify the authenticity and jurisdiction of the requesting authority
 - Review each demand for legal validity, scope, and compliance with applicable laws
 - Challenge demands that appear unlawful, overbroad, or in violation of user rights
 - Provide only the specific information explicitly required by the demand
 - Maintain detailed records of all requests and our responses
 - Require compensation for costs incurred in responding to requests where permitted by law

 ### 4.5 Data Preservation
 When served with a valid preservation request from law enforcement, the Company will preserve relevant account records in accordance with applicable law. Preservation requests may be extended or renewed by the requesting agency as permitted by law.

 ### 4.6 International Requests
 For legal demands originating from jurisdictions outside the United States, the Company requires requests to be made through established international legal frameworks, such as Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) or other appropriate diplomatic channels. We will evaluate international requests based on U.S. law, international obligations, and human rights standards.

 ## 5. Platform Operations

Users may appeal moderation decisions by submitting a formal appeal within 30 days of the action. Appeals must include the specific action being contested, relevant context, and supporting documentation. The Company will review appeals within a reasonable timeframe and communicate decisions through official channels. Appeal decisions are final and binding.
