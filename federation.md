## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines our approach to federation and domain blocking within the Fediverse network, emphasizing user autonomy while maintaining necessary safeguards against harmful behavior.

## 2. Core Principles

We believe in empowering users to make their own content decisions. Users maintain full authority to block individual accounts and domains according to their preferences, rather than relying on service-wide domain blocks.

## 3. Defederation Criteria

Our instance will only implement service-wide domain blocks when servers meet one or both of the following criteria:

### 3.1 Technical Abuse
The server engages in disruptive technical behavior, including but not limited to:
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- Spam distribution
- Attempted circumvention of rate limits
- Attempted circumvention of user blocks, content mutes, or other user privacy settings

### 3.2 Harmful Content
The server's primary purpose is to distribute:
- Content that promotes hatred or toxicity
- Illegal or unethical material
- Child exploitation materials
- Extreme violence or gore
- Coordinated spam campaigns

## 4. External Block List Implementation

While we reference the Tier 0 Oliphant block list as a valuable resource for identifying problematic instances, we do not automatically implement its recommendations. Each listing undergoes internal review to ensure it meets our specific defederation criteria.

## 5. Policy Enforcement

Our administrative team conducts prompt evaluations when instances are reported or identified as potentially violating these criteria. While some situations may require careful consideration, our experience has shown that violations of these standards are typically clear and actionable.

## 6. Reporting Blocked Instances

To report an instance for review under this policy, please email admin@theatl.social with relevant details and documentation.

## 7. Transparency

A current list of blocked Mastodon servers and Bluesky servers or domains (as applicable under that service) is maintained at [/support/blocks](/support/blocks) for public reference.

## 8. Review and Updates

This policy is subject to periodic review and may be updated to address emerging challenges within the Fediverse ecosystem. We welcome community feedback and questions regarding these guidelines.

*For questions or clarification about this policy, please contact the instance administrators.*
